# Slideforthe.world

This is the frontend for slideforthe.world. 

It won first place at SDSU's Programming Design Contest! 

## Playing on the website

First, you need to go on https://slideforthe.world/ and login, either with an email or anonymously. 

After that, you will be taken to the main screen, from which you can create a game or switch the board image. 

To play against yourself, just press create a game and start game without an additional person. To play against someone else, press the "create a game" button and have someone else go on https://slidefortheworld.co/, and type the code in. After they get in, start the game. 

You can feasibly play along with many, many people. 

## Code

Most of this code was written by Samyok on a 12 hour sprint. For some reason, most of the source files corrupted or just didn't upload, and as such, they are all blank. The compiled files do exist though.
